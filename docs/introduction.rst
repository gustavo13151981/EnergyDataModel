What is EnergyDataModel?
------------------------

EnergyDataModel is an open-source Python library that lets you represent energy systems as Python 
[data classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) for improved modularity and 
readability. It gives a blueprint for how energy engineers and energy data scientists can leverage
software engineering best practices to improve productivity and collaboration. 

Why EnergyDataModel? 
-------------------------
EnergyDataModel lets you:

- 🧱 **Modularity** - Represent energy assets, energy systems and other relevant concepts as object-oriented building blocks;

- 🏗️ **Relationships** - Structure your energy assets in graphs and hierarchies representing energy systems that can be serialized to files (e.g. .csv, .json, and .geojson files);

- 👀 **Visualization** - Visualise energy systems maps, graphs, flows and structure using built-in plotting functions;

- 🤓 **Readability** - Write more explicit Python code through human-readable expressions and built-in convenience methods;

- 🧩 **Interoperability** - Convert data format to other energy-relevant data models and ontologies; and

- 💬 **Communicate** - Communicate effectively in teams with a common energy system data vocabulary.
